# sort-algorithm

A sorting algorithm is an algorithm made up of a series of instructions that takes an array as input, performs specified operations  

 on the array,sometimes called a list, and outputs a sorted array. Sorting algorithms are

often taught early in computer science classes as they provide a straightforward way to introduce other key

computer science topics like Big-O notation, divide-and-conquer methods, and data structures such as binary

trees, and heaps. There are many factors to consider when choosing a sorting algorithm to use.
